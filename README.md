## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results 
The graph above shows a multiple-line graph (1A) for  total weekly fares for each city type. Results from this graph reveal that overall, the urban city type has the highest fares weekly. The graph also reveals a trend that each city type has g a peak in total fare amount in late February (except for the Rural which has its highest fare in April). 

## Summary 
The city table breakdown(1B) shows for rural and suburban city types the number of total rides exceeds the number of total drivers. This gives drivers in the rural and suburban cities more average fare per rides and average fare per driver. A few suggestions I would make for the CEO of PyBer would be to increase driver marketing tactics in the springtime for rural and suburban areas to support the number of rides. This will increase the number of rides drivers are able to handle and in large part increase the total fare amount. I would also use marketing tactics to highlight the urban city type total fare amount exhibited in the multiple-line graph (1A). This will give future employees a scope of how much income they can possibly make as an employee.
